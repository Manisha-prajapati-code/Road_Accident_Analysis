# Road_Accident_Analysis


## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze traffic accident data to:
- Identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
- Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.
- Provide actionable insights to improve road safety and reduce accidents.

---

## Problem Statement
Road accidents are a major cause of fatalities and injuries worldwide. Understanding the patterns behind accidents can help:
1. Identify high-risk times, locations, and conditions.
2. Highlight the impact of weather and road conditions.
3. Develop effective traffic management and safety strategies.

Key Challenges:
- Large volumes of accident data are often underutilized.
- Identifying critical accident hotspots and causes requires effective visualization and analysis.
- Weather and time-based correlations are not always straightforward.

## Solution
This project addresses the problem by:
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Loading and cleaning the accident dataset.
   - Extracting critical features such as accident time, weather, and road conditions.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Identifying accident distribution across different times of the day.
   - Analyzing the impact of weather and road conditions on accidents.
   - Highlighting accident hotspots using visualizations.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Multiple subplots for analyzing time-based, weather-based, and location-based accident patterns.
   - Use of libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for clear and insightful plots.

4. **Insights**:
   - Peak accident hours (e.g., morning and evening rush hours).
   - Increased accidents during adverse weather conditions (foggy and rainy).
   - Identification of high-risk locations for targeted interventions.

## Insights
1. **Time-Based Analysis**:
   - Accidents are more frequent during rush hours (8:00 AM - 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM).
   - Late-night accidents are often linked to fatigue and low visibility.

2. **Weather Impact**:
   - Foggy and rainy weather conditions significantly increase accident rates.
   - Clear weather accidents may be due to overconfidence and speeding.

3. **Road Conditions**:
   - Wet roads have higher accident rates due to reduced traction.
   - Dry roads witness accidents caused by overspeeding.

4. **Location Hotspots**:
   - Certain intersections and highways see a higher frequency of accidents.
